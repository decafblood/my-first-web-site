  <h2>Big bang</h2>
  <strong>The <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/big-bang/en/" target="_blank" title="Big bang specification"><u>Big bang</u></a></strong> is how astronomers explain the way the universe began. It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right nowâ€”and it is still stretching!
  <p>When the universe began, it was just hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy. It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down. The tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies.

  </p><p>The first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together. As new stars were being born and dying, then things like asteroids, comets, planets, and black holes formed!</p>
